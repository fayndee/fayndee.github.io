Waiting for sunrise at the famous El Bufadero, a big rock hole constantly get filled & emptied by sea water, located in the east coast of Gran Canaria.

The scene was great when the sun starts to pop up. It was also a good opportunity to get salty wet if you are careless like me, my camera and I got washed several times by the big waves.
