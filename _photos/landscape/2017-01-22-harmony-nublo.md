Roque Nublo in Gran Canaria, Spain. One of the most popular location on the island.

Nublo means frog/cloud in Spanish. It was quite froggy that day, I immediately realize it would be
a perfect occasion to shoot this "froggy rock". The road uphill was a quite tricky journey, full of
hairpin turns and weather was not helping. It took me one and a half hours to get the Pico de las
Nieves, the highest peak on the island.

The shot was taken shortly before sunset, when the frog was forming even stronger. One can barely
see the sun and the mountains afar. In the end the sunlight created this dreamy looking scenery
that I call harmony. :)
