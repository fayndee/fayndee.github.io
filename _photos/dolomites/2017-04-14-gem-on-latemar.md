Spring Latemar mountain view from the gem-like Karersee.

This shot took me a long waiting time. Waiting for clouds to be dyed with the sunlight; waiting for the mountain and trees to get a kiss of the setting sun; waiting for the wind to stop so the lake surface could calm down. It's all about waiting! Until everything just met perfectly, for the blink of an eye.
