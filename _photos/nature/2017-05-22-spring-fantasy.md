A spring adventure at Josefsthaler Waterfall.

The waterfall is located in a small Bavaria town called Josefsthal. It's only 10 mins walk from the nearest parking place.

The weather was a bit cloudy, perfect for this kind of shot. The capture was taken when the sunlight has penetrated into the forest, casting a nice warm color on the leaves.
