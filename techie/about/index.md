> # Think wild, do mild.

I'm Fang Yuan, a single-minded developer with a wide open mindset. I embrace "learning by doing" and believe all the brilliant ideas are born from the practice.

I'm passionate about software design and fascinated about growing architecture from the ground up. That's usually how I get my brain cells wasted, although I don't smoke.

I work for a Munich-based online retailer - Zooplus, where I'm known as developer `/sla É/` architect. Doing that for years, it seems that I still don't know how to get away from taking new challenges. Luckily there are always smart and capable people around me, who help, coach and mentor me along the way. I'm thankful for these lovely people and this gratitude keeps me going.
