> # Think wilder, do milder.

I'm Fang Yuan, a single-minded developer with a wide open mindset. I embrace "learning by doing" and
believe all the brilliant ideas are born from the practice.

I'm passionate about software design and fascinated about growing architecture from the ground up.
That's usually how I get my brain cells wasted, although I actually do not smoke.

I work for a Munich-based online retailer - Zooplus, where I hold the literally obvious yet
never-learnt-enough role of "Team Lead Engineer".
