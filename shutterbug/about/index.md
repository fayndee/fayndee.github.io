I'm Fang Yuan, a photography enthusiast who believes in all good things. Like a child, I love
magical lights, sharp reflections, and diverse colors. The eyes of observing beauty are I always
believe to have.

A few years back, when I got my first DSLR camera, I thought that was it, _I got it all_, the
visionary and mastery of the imagery. Very soon after that, things went wrong and minds got confused.
As usual, there is always more to learn, especially something you 'think' you are good at.
